# Cleaning and Preparation

The data was imported to a new table created in a PostgreSQL databse for inspection, cleaning, and preparation for analysis.

The table was defined with column names and datatypes corresponding to the `.csv` header names.

# EDA, Cleaning, Processing

### üî∑ Create `TEMP TABLE` to manipulate during cleaning and processing.

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE sales_temp AS
	SELECT *
	FROM sales_raw;

```

<br>

---

### üî∑ Check for missing values in dataset (all columns).

<details>
    <summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_values
FROM sales_temp
WHERE invoice_no ISNULL OR stock_code ISNULL OR description ISNULL
	OR quantity ISNULL OR invoice_date ISNULL OR unit_price ISNULL
	OR customer_id ISNULL OR country ISNULL OR quantity <= 0 OR
	unit_price <= 0;

```
</details>

| null_values |
|-------------|
| 144025	  |


<br>

---

### üî∑ Dive deeper into missing values - column by column.

- All columns were checked individually for `NULL` values using `COUNT(*)` and `WHERE` 
*`column_name`* `ISNULL`.  
- `quantity` and `unit_price` were checked for negative or 0 values.

<br>

**Two columns contained `NULL` values: `description` and `customer_id`.**

-	**`description`**

	<details>
		<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
		
	```sql

	SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_values
	FROM sales_temp
	WHERE description ISNULL;

	```
	</details>

	| null_values |
	|-------------|
	| 1454		  |

	<br>

-	**`customer_id`**

	<details>
		<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
		
	```sql

	SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_values
	FROM sales_temp
	WHERE customer_id ISNULL;

	```
	</details>

	| null_values |
	|-------------|
	| 135080	  |

	<br>

**`quantity` and `unit_price` both contained negative or 0 values.**

-	**`quantity`**

	<details>
		<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
		
	```sql

	SELECT COUNT(*) AS less_0
	FROM sales_temp
	WHERE quantity <= 0

	```
	</details>

	| less_0 |
	|--------|
	| 10624  |

	<br>

-	**`unit_price`**

	<details>
		<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
		
	```sql

	SELECT COUNT(unit_price)
	FROM sales_raw
	WHERE unit_price <= 0;

	```
	</details>

	| less_0 |
	|--------|
	| 2517  |

### ‚ùó Issue: 
* **There are columns with missing data: NULL and 0 values.**
### üõ†Ô∏è Action: 
* **Remove rows with NULL or 0 values from the dataset.**
  
*A real world dataset would require further investigation, but we will proceed w/ removing the rows w/ missing data for the purpose of this analysis.*

```sql

DELETE FROM sales_temp2 
	WHERE quantity <= 0 
		OR	description ISNULL 
		OR	unit_price <= 0 
		OR customer_id ISNULL;

```
<br>

- **Confirm successful update.**

	<details>
		<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
	
	```sql
	
	SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing
	FROM sales_temp
		WHERE quantity <= 0

			OR	unit_price <= 0 
			OR customer_id ISNULL
	
	```
	</details>
	
	**Results Summary:**
	
	| missing |
	|---------|
	| 0       |

### üî∑ Does every stock_code match a description?

<details>
    <summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
	
```sql

SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT stock_code) AS stock_codes,

| stock_codes | descriptions |
|---------------|--------------|
| 3665          | 3877         |

<br>

### ‚ùó Issue: 
* **There are fewer stock_code values than description values in the dataset.**

### üõ†Ô∏è Action: 
* **Investigate why there are more descriptions than stock codes.**

	- Create `TEMP TABLE` with all stock codes and descriptions.
	- Partition by stock codes to assign row numbers to every `stock_code`-`description` pair.
	- Query this table to return results of only stock codes that have more than one description.
	
		<details>
			<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
			
		```sql
	
		CREATE TEMP TABLE stock_rows AS (

				ORDER BY stock_code

### ‚ùó Issue: 
* **Some stock codes were input with multiple descriptions.**

### üõ†Ô∏è Action: 
* **Find and eliminate redundant descriptions for stock codes.**
	
	- Create `TEMP TABLE` that only contains stock codes with first returned description. Use this in an `UPDATE` statement to replace redundant descriptions.
	
		<details>
			<summary><strong>üîé View Query</strong></summary><br>
	
		```sql

		SET description	= (
			SELECT usd.description
			FROM unique_stock_desc usd

### ‚ùó Issue: 
* **After description update, there are more unique stock codes than descriptions.**

### üõ†Ô∏è Action: 
* **Investigate why some descriptions would have multiple stock codes.**
	
	- Return stock codes that have multiple descriptions.
