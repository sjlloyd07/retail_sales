# Cleaning and Preparation

The data was copied to a new PostgreSQL database table for inspection, cleaning, and preparation for analysis.

The table was defined with column names and datatypes corresponding to the `.csv` header names.

	The resulting list of description/stock_code pairs reveals 2 issues:
    - Some repeating descriptions have stock_codes that match but have different character capitalization.
	- Some repeating descriptions have stock_codes that are in series: serialized odd digits.

-	‚ùó **Issue:**
